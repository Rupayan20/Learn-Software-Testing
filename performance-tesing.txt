Day 12: Performance Testing and It's Types With Real life Examples

-> Performance Testing: Performance testing is a software testing technique that evaluates how well an application performs under different conditions, such as different user loads, data volumes, and network environments.
   Check Stability and Response Time based on Conditions.

-> Types of Performance Testing:
  i) Load Testing: Load testing is a type of testing which involves evaluating the performance of the system under the expected workload.
  ii) Stress Testing: Stress testing is a type of performance testing where we evaluate the application's performance at load much higher than the expected load.
  iii) Spike Testing: In Spike testing, we analyze the behavior of the system on suddenly increasing the number of users.
  iv) Volume Testing: The Volume testing is performed by feeding the application with a high volume of data.

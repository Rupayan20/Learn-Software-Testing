Day 10: Use Case Testing In Software Testing 

-> What is Use Case?
Ans> - Means User interaction and its Behaviours.
     - How System Respond to User Actions.
     - Its a Document of the Actions performed by User and how system behaved on it.

-> Elements in Use Case:
   i) Description,
   ii) Actor,
   iii) Pre Condition,
   iv) Action (a. Basic Flow, b. Alternate Flow, c. Exception Flow),
   v) Post Condition

-> Types of Use Cases:
   i) Basic use cases: These are simple and straightforward use cases that test the most fundamental functionality of a system.
      There are typical the first use cases to be tested, as they provide a baseline for the overall functionality of the system.

   ii) Alternative use cases: These are use cases that test alternative or exception paths within the system such as error handling or alternative input values.

   iii) Boundary use cases: These are use cases that test the limits or boundaries of the system, such as maximum or minimum input values, or the handling f large or complex data sets.

   iv) Negative use cases: These are use cases that test the system's ability to handle invalid or correct input, or to detect and prevent errors or security vulnerabilities.

   v) Integral use cases: These are use cases that test how the system integrates with systems or processes, such as data import/export or API integration.

   vi) Performance use cases: These are use cases that test the system's performance and scalability, such as response time and resource usage under different load conditions.

   vii) Another few Sunny Day vs Rainy Day.
        a) Sunny day use cases, also known as "happy path" or "normal" use cases.
        b) Rainy day use cases, also known as "exceptional" or "negative" use cases, test the system's ability to handle abnormal or unexpected conditions.

-> How to write Use Cases?
Ans> i) What's the primary use for the customer?
     ii) A strong Use Case can impress the audience even if they have minor mistakes.
     iii) This is an iterative process, which means when we write them for the first time it won't ne perfect.

-> Example:
E-Commerce Website/Application:
 i) Actors -> Buyer, Sellers, Wholesale Dealers, Auditors, Suppliers, Distributors, Customers etc.
 ii) Actions -> Sign up, Login, Searech, Product Add/Buy etc.

-> What is Use Case Testing:
   i) It ensures that the path used by the user is working as intended or not. It makes sure that the user can accomplish the task successfully.
   ii) No Relation with the Quality.
   iii) Type of end-to-end testing.
   iv) It will find out the defects in integration testing.
   v) Test case template (template link: https://sdet.live/tc-template).
   vi) Login to App.vwo.com
   vii) Actors -> User, Admin, Sub Admin, Editor, Manager
   viii) Pre Condition -> Login page is loaded.
   ix) Post Condition -> User should be logged in.

-> Example of Use Cases: Main Scenarios -> Steps
                                    a. Valid U and Valid P
                                    b. Valid U and Invalid P
                                    c. Invalid U and Valid P
                                    d. Invalid U and Invalid P

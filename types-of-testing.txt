-> Unit Testing: Type of software testing where individual units or components of software are tested.
   Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs.
   A developer writes a section of code in the application just to test the function. They would later comment out and finally remove the test code when the application is destroyed.
   A coder generally uses a UnitTest Framework to develop automated test cases.

-> Code coverage techniques used in Unit Testing:
   i) Statement Coverage,
   ii) Decision Coverage,
   iii) Branch Coverage,
   iv) Condition Coverage,
   v) Finite State Machine Coverage.
